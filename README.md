1. ⚡ Project Title:
Sustainable Optimization of Electric Vehicle Charging Infrastructure Using Machine Learning

2. 🧭 Overview:
This project focuses on building a machine learning model to analyze and optimize EV charging station networks for sustainability. Using the Electric Vehicle Charging Stations 2024 dataset, it applies geospatial analytics and green AI concepts to identify key factors influencing station placement, usage, and cost.
The goal is to support data-driven urban planning that promotes energy efficiency, reduces carbon impact, and enhances accessibility for EV users. This project integrates green skills such as sustainable AI, geospatial data handling, and eco-efficient system design.

3.	🎯 Objectives
•	Predict potential locations for future EV charging stations based on population, current station distribution, and accessibility data.
•	Optimize network planning to reduce the average travel distance for EV users, minimizing energy waste and emissions.
•	Promote green mobility by identifying underserved or high-impact regions for sustainable infrastructure expansion.

4.	🌱 Expected Outcome
•	A data-driven sustainability map and ML model that help governments, city planners, or energy companies expand EV charging infrastructure responsibly, aligning with green skills in renewable transport planning and sustainable urban design.
